        <div class="words">What does it mean to be successful in the 21st century? If I told you that there was a very successful person on your street, who would you imagine? Someone in a suit with a well-paying job and a progressing career. It's unlikely to be someone stagnant or in a typically looked down upon job, regardless of their self-satisfaction and emotional well-being. The perception of success being tied to easily communicated concepts, such as material wealth, job position and even grades on a test, is damaging to the self-esteem and happiness of the general public, particularly under 20s. Redefining societal ideas of success will make for a happier population.
      </div><div class="words">
        In order to understand why the traditional model for success is so intertwined with material wealth, it is important to examine how material wealth affects us emotionally. A study on the relationship between a growing national income and the life satisfaction of a nation's citizens showed a clear positive correlation (Hagerty and Veenhoven, 2003). So is the age old saying money can't buy happiness false? Only in a utilitarian sense. With greater economic wealth comes a higher general standard of living for the countries citizens, their diets can be healthier or they can afford better education for their children. However notice how in the charts below ,a significant increase In GDP (the pink line), will only have a minor effect on the 10 point scale of life satisfaction (the blue dots).
      </div><div class="words">
        This is because the great attraction of wealth doesn't come from the small utilitarian gain the population gets in the long term, but from the immediate and relatively meteoric rise an individual feels when suddenly encountering wealth through getting a new well-paid job or a promotion. Behind the immense feelings of joy associated with these instances is the idea of comparative wealth. In a study of 16,000 East and West Germans between 1992-97 (Ferrer-i-Carbonell, 2005), while an increase in wealth led to a small increase in subjective well-being, an increase in wealth accompanied by an identical increases in the surrounding reference groups reported virtually no change in well-being. As well as this it showed that while happiness of the poorer German population was negatively affected by having a lower income than their reference group, the more wealthy West Germans didn't feel particularly happier knowing that there were poorer people in their reference group. Imagine you have just received a pay rise, you leave your boss's office feeling ecstatic, you can't wait to get home and tell your partner, your friends. Now imagine you've arrived at the water cooler, only to find out another co-worker has received one as well, and not just you two, but everyone on your floor of the office. Sure, you still get paid a slightly higher salary, but the joy that comes with comparison is gone.
        In a lot of cases, a higher income acts as a status symbol. It's about the desire to feel superior to your peers, and be able to show your superiority. There's a reason the most popular colour of Ferrari is red and not black (Rees, 2018). However, while a sharp increase in material wealth can allow you to afford these luxury items, you quickly acclimatize and seek more and more. Daniel Kahneman, winner of a Nobel Prize in economics calls this the 'aspirational treadmill' (Kahneman, 2018). The allure of wealth is undeniable, but associating it with success will continue to lead individuals down unfulfilling paths at the promise of light at the end of the tunnel. It's bad for the individual as well as society as a whole when happiness in wealth relies on others remaining in their place.
      </div><div class="words">
        How has social status become such a deciding factor for us to base our value system on, when it is both extrinsic and largely unfulfilling in the long term? The impact social status has on happiness is a very personal metric that is decided by the people who are a continual presence in your life (Anderson et al., 2012). It's clear that social comparison has been a presence for almost all human history and a social hierarchy can be seen in many different species of mammals. However I believe that it's being compounded by the unprecedented ease with which we can signal status and so make these comparisons. The global phenomenon of social media is one example of a cause for this heightened awareness of social status. It works largely in the same way advertising does, through a presentation of a lifestyle that you could be living if only you succumbed to your material desires. The important distinction between a newspaper advert and the Instagram story is that the Instagram story works under the guise of reality, whereas a newspaper advert is sectioned off from the real. The images of food that we associate so strongly with social media, works on the same level as a 17th century still life painting of food, which advertises the wealth of the owner through romanticised depictions of what they eat. What's important to notice is the connotation of 'realness' both images above have; in both the food is abundant and half eaten, there is a presence of a human there, who is the real subject. It's their interaction with the food that we're looking at and aspiring to, not the food itself. This guise of reality is only intensified by the close relationships we feel we can form with many more people in a way that wasn't possible before. Because we care more about our social status in relation to the people we are close to, having a larger friendship group due to social media means the social ladder we feel we need to climb is much higher than it ever was. These fundamental shifts in our social structure mean that more than ever we need to redefine how we measure success, in order to obtain happiness. Without this, we will continue to be predisposed to chase this unattainable 'good life' resulting in a dissatisfied population.
      </div><div class="words">
        How do we even begin a shift away from wealth, and in turn the social ladder, being so important to our perception of success? Being high up in your relative social group provides you benefits in how you're treated day to day (Nelissen and Meijers, 2011), but for everyone at the top there must be someone at the bottom. Because of this it becomes useless as a societal model, it's inherently a zero-sum game, a core reason being because it looks for fulfilment in extrinsic factors, meaning factors based on people and things other than yourself. In order to fully realise your own potential, there has to be a balance between an intrinsic and extrinsic reward system. In academic situations for example, purely extrinsic factors such as punishments for not doing work will only work so far, whereas "portraying activities as serving the attainment of an intrinsic rather than an extrinsic goal promotes deeper processing of the learning material, greater conceptual understanding of it, and both short-term and long-term persistence at relevant learning tasks" (Vansteenkiste, Lens and Deci, 2006). This isn't to say that extrinsic motivation doesn't have its place, however  a meta-analysis by researchers at the University of Rochester and McGill University concluded that adding a tangible reward to a task will have a "substantially negative effect on intrinsic motivation" (Deci, Koestner and Ryan, 1999). Suddenly the reward becomes the reason for doing something rather than the doing in and of itself. This is the fundamental issue behind our current success system: it relies far too heavily on extrinsic rewards. If society convinces you down this conventional path of success of becoming for example, a doctor, achieving high grades or having a huge house and a sports car, validation and fulfilment must increasingly come from extrinsic factors, which becomes cyclical and unstable. In order to be truly fulfilled you must work to find something you enjoy regardless of any connotations or stigma around it.
      </div><div>
        While we're slowly becoming more open to alternative ideas of success, through exposure to broadening ranges of media, these changes are simply not happening fast enough. Attitudes need to change at the primary and secondary education level most drastically, and a wider range of examples of a successful adult need to be shown. In our schools there are plenty of talks about great politicians and famous athletes, people who have sacrificed everything to get where they are, but we're well aware that this isn't feasible for the majority of students. It's presenting an idealised image that is virtually impossible to compete with. Instead, there needs to be greater focus on less glamourous but equally, if not more fulfilling ways to live. The aim would be to have as many people in an intrinsically motivated profession as possible, giving people the freedom to pursue what they want without societal pressures dictating their path.
